# Lifting

## Novice Linear Progression

This program is an introduction to the core compound lifts. Exercises will be
done in 5 sets of 5 reps, progressing 5 lbs per workout until linear progress
stalls at heavy weights.

The routine consists of alternating workouts

### Workout A

- Squats 5x5
- Bench Press 5x5
- Chin Ups 5x5

### Workout B

- Squats 5x5
- Deadlifts 1x5
- Overhead Press 5x5

If you are able to complete all 25 reps with good form, add 5 lbs to the 
training weight on the next day you perform the lift. If you struggle to
complete a set, repeat that weight until you are able to successful execute the
workout.

# Diet

## Slow Bulking

As a beginning lifter, you'll be able to make strength gains quickly. We'll take
advantage of this by making sure that you're in a slight calorie surplus. This
ensure that you're recovering and building muscle at your maximum capacity while
learning these compound lifts.

To ensure that we're in a calorie surplus, we're going to start tracking your
nutrient intake. Choose a food tracking app that you like and start keeping
track of everything you eat. Strive to be as exact as possible. When you're at
home, weigh out your food with a food scale. If you don't have a food label
available, take a guess. Building the habit of keeping good track of your intake
will be a big determining factor in reaching your goals.

### Determinining Your Macros

#### Protein

Your daily protein goal will be 1 gram per pound of body weight per day. So, for
example, if you weigh 180 lbs try to eat 180 grams of protein from your food
every day. This will ensure that you're getting adequate protein to facilitate
muscle growth. Don't worry too much if you're a little short, the science says
you see diminishing returns a little before 1g/lb/day anyway, but this is easy 
to remember and a good baseline.

#### Calories

We're going to determine your calorie needs by first determining roughly what
your baseline expenditure is right now. So, you're going to start doing 3 things
right away:

1. Tracking the food you're eating
2. Eating enough protein to clear the goal of 1g/lb/day
3. Recording your weight every day

Once we have a 2 weeks of data about how much you've eaten and how much your
average weight has changed, we'll be able to calculate your maintenance
calories. We'll add 250 calories to that, and that will be your daily calorie
goal.

As we progress with training, you'll continue to track your weight and calorie
intake. That way, if we find that you start to gain weight too slowly (or lose
weight) on average we can increase your calories. Similarly, if you start to
gain weight too quickly, we can pull back the calories a bit and make sure that
you're staying lean. That allows us to maximize the time we spend in the bulking
phase.
